# Scalable Kafka Message Bus Study

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to be a study about developing
a message bus dialogue between two services using Apache Kafka and
other technologies.

## Can I help?
Sure thing! I am mainly working solo on this, but any suggestion, comments
and feedback are welcome. Please feel free to drop me a message, create an issue
or comment it out.

## Why Kafka?
One of the good features of using Kafka as message-bus is the possibility of fast persisted replayable
message storage. Other message brokers/technologies are also good, but there are a few approaches
that I want to explore in this study.

## Can I use this for my own project? (Commercial / Personal)
Yeah, feel free to clone, fork, copy, and use it, but be aware that I don't provide any
garantee that this is the best approach, does not have pitfalls or even that is functional.
I will do my best ;)
