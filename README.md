# Scalable Kafka Message Bus Example

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to be a study about developing
a message bus dialog between two services using Apache Kafka and
other technologies.

## Can I help?
Sure thing! I mainly working solo on this, but any suggestion, comments
and feedback are welcome. Please feel free to drop me a message, create issue
or comment it out.

## Why Kafka?
Also intended to develop a version of this same project using MQTT and other message
brokers; But right now, I have a idea that I want to exercise and benchmark.

## Can I use this for my own project? (Commercial / Personal)
Yeah, feel free to clone, fork, copy, and use it, but be aware that I don't provide any
garanty that this is the best approach, does not have pitfalls or even if it is functional.
I will do my best ;)
